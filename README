DESCRIPTION
    The subroutines in the "Data::SecsPack" module packs and unpacks numbers
    in accordance with SEMI E5-94. The E5-94 establishes the standard for
    communication between the equipment used to fabricate semiconductors and
    the host computer that controls the fabrication. The equipment in a
    semiconductor factory (fab) or any other fab contains every conceivable
    known microprocessor and operating system known to man. And there are a
    lot of specialize real-time embedded processors and speciallize
    real-time embedded operating systems in addition to the those in the PC
    world.

    The communcication between host and equipment used packed nested list
    data structures that include arrays of characters, integers and floats.
    The standard has been in place and widely used in china, germany, korea,
    japan, france, italy and the most remote places on this planent for
    decades. The basic data structure and packed data formats have not
    changed for decades.

    This stands in direct contradiction to common conceptions of many in the
    Perl community. The following quote is taken from page 761, *Programming
    Perl* third edition, discussing the "pack" subroutine:

    "Floating-point numbers are in the native machine format only. Because
    of the variety of floating format and lack of a standard "network"
    represenation, no facility for interchange has been made. This means
    that packed floating-point data written on one machine may not be
    readable on another. That is a problem even when both machines use IEEE
    floating-point arithmetic, because the endian-ness of memory
    representation is not part of the IEEE spec."

    SEMI E5-94 and their precessors do standardize the endian-ness of
    floating point, the packing of nested data, used in many programming
    languages, and much, much more. The nested data has many performance
    advantages over the common SQL culture of viewing and representing data.
    The automated fabs of the world make use of nested data not only for
    communication between machines but also for local processing at the host
    and equipment.

    The endian-ness of SEMI E5-94 is the first MSB byte. Maybe this is
    because it makes it easy to spot numbers in a packed data structure.

    SEMI E5-94, section 6 Data Structures, establishes the requirements for
    the data strutures and data items.

  pack_int subroutine

     ($format, $integers) = pack_int($format, @string_integers);

    The "pack_int" subroutine takes an array of strings, <@string_integers>,
    and a format code, as specifed in the above "Item Format Code Table" and
    packs the integers, "$integers" in the "$format" in accordance with
    "SEMI E5-94". The "pack_int" subroutine also accepts the format code "I1
    I2 I8" and format codes with out the bytes-per-element number and packs
    the numbers in the format using the less space, with unsigned preferred
    over signed. In any case, the "pack_int" subroutine returns the correct
    "$format" of the packed "$integers".

    When the "pack_int" encounters an error, it returns "undef" for
    "$format" and a description of the error as "$integers". All the
    "@string_integers" must be valid Perl numbers.

  pack_num subroutine

     ($format, $numbers, $string) = pack_num($format, @strings);

    Currently "pack_num" only supports integers. The support of floating
    point is under development.

    The "pack_num" subroutine does a quick scan of "@strings" to see if it
    can find a floating point number. If the "pack_num" routine finds a
    float, it returns "floating point under development" error; otherwise,
    it processes "@strings" for integers.

    The "pack_num" subroutine process "@strings" for integers in two steps.
    The "pack_num" subroutine uses "str2int" to convert the parse the
    leading numbers from the "@strings" as follows:

     ($string, @integers) = str2int(@strings); 

    The "pack_num" subroutine uses "pack_int" to pack the "@integers" in
    accordance with SEMI E5-94 as follows:

     ($format, $numbers) = pack_int($format, @string_integers);

    The results of the integer processing is the array

     C<($format, $numbers, $string)>

    The "str2int" subroutine does not report any errors while the "pack_int"
    routine and thus the "pack_num" routine reports errors by an undefined
    "$format" and the error message in "$numbers"

  str2int subroutine

     $integer = str2int($string);
     ($string, @integers) = str2int(@strings); 

    The "Data::SecsPack" program module translates an scalar string to a
    scalar integer. Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that
    converts a scalar to so that its internal storage is an integer (See
    p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl). If it cannot perform the
    conversion, it leaves the integer 0. Surprising not all Perls, some
    Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave the internal storage as a
    scalar string.

    The scalar "str2int" subroutine is basically the same except if it
    cannot perform the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef"
    instead of a 0. Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it
    will return an undef. This makes it not only useful for forcing an
    integer conversion but also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact
    an integer scalar. The scalar "str2int" is the same and supercedes
    C&<Data::Str2Num::str2int>. The "Data::SecsPack" program module
    superceds the "Data::Str2Num" program module.

    The "str2int" subroutine in an array context supports converting
    multiple run of numbers in an array of strings "@strings" to an array of
    integers, "@integers". It keeps converting the strings, starting with
    the first string in "@strings", continuing to the next and next until it
    fails an conversion. The "str2int" returns the join of the remaining
    strings in "@strings" and the array of integers "@integers".

  unpack_num subroutine

     \@numbers = unpack_num($format, $string_numbers); 

    The "unpack_num" subroutine unpacks an array of numbers
    "$string_numbers" packed in accordance with SEMI-E5 "$format". A valid
    "$format" is in accordance with the above "Item Format Code Table". The
    floating point formats "F4 F8" return the error "Floating point under
    development".

    The "unpack_num" returns a reference, "\@numbers", to the unpacked
    number array or scalar error message "$error". To determine a valid
    return or an error, check that "ref" of the return exists or is
    '"ARRAY"'.

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The "Data::SecsPack" module extends the Perl language (the system).

    The subroutines in the "Data::SecsPack" module packs and unpacks numbers
    in accordance with SEMI E5-94. The E5-94 establishes the standard for
    communication between the equipment used to fabricate semiconductors and
    the host computer that controls the fabrication. The equipment in a
    semiconductor factory (fab) or any other fab contains every conceivable
    known microprocessor and operating system known to man. And there are a
    lot of specialize real-time embedded processors and speciallize
    real-time embedded operating systems in addition to the those in the PC
    world.

    The communcication between host and equipment used packed nested list
    data structures that include arrays of characters, integers and floats.
    The standard has been in place and widely used in china, germany, korea,
    japan, france, italy and the most remote places on this planent for
    decades. The basic data structure and packed data formats have not
    changed for decades. This stands in direct contradiction to common
    conceptions of many in the Perl community.

    The "Data::Str2int" module translates an scalar string to a scalar
    integer. Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a
    scalar to so that its internal storage is an integer (See p.351, 3rd

    leaves the integer 0. Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in
    particular, may leave the internal storage as a scalar string.

    The <str2int> function is basically the same except if it cannot perform

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths
