 for

 Data::SecsPack - pack and unpack numbers in accordance with SEMI E5-94

 Revision: D

 Version: 0.05

 Date: 2004/05/10

 Prepared for: General Public 

 Prepared by:  SoftwareDiamonds.com E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The "L<Data::SecsPack|Data::SecsPack>" module extends the Perl language (the system).

The subroutines in the C<Data::SecsPack> module packs and unpacks
numbers in accordance with SEMI E5-94. The E5-94 establishes the
standard for communication between the equipment used to fabricate
semiconductors and the host computer that controls the fabrication.
The equipment in a semiconductor factory (fab) or any other fab
contains every conceivable known microprocessor and operating system
known to man. And there are a lot of specialize real-time embedded 
processors and speciallize real-time embedded operating systems
in addition to the those in the PC world.

The communcication between host and equipment used packed
nested list data structures that include arrays of characters,
integers and floats. The standard has been in place and widely
used in China, Germany, Korea, Japan, France, Italy and
the most remote places on this planent for decades.
The SEMI E5 standard was first finalized in 1985 and has
not changed much over the decades.
The basic data structure and packed data formats have not
changed for decades. 
This stands in direct contradiction to common conceptions
of many in the Perl snail-time community that
there is no standard for transferring such things as
binary floats between machines little less sending
nested list data as small compact binary.

The C<Data::Str2int> module translates an scalar string to a scalar integer.
Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to
so that its internal storage is an integer
(See p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl).
If it cannot perform the conversion, it leaves the integer 0.
Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave
the internal storage as a scalar string.

The <str2int> function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an undef.
This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion but
also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

=head2 3.3 Changes

Changes are as follows:

=over 4

=item Data::SecsPack 0.01

Originated

=item Data::SecsPack 0.02

Adding support for packing and unpacking
floats and flushing out to provide full
support for packing and unpacking all
SEMI E5-94 SECSII numeric formats.

=item Data::SecsPack 0.03

There were the same test software failures and Unit Under Test (UUT) failures
for the following platforms:

 Subject: FAIL Data-SecsPack-0.02 ppc-darwin-thread-multi 7.2.0 
 From: nothingmuch@woobling.org 
 perl5: (revision 5.0 version 8 subversion 3) configuration:
 Platform: osname=darwin, osvers=7.2.0, archname=ppc-darwin-thread-multi

 From: "Thurn, Martin" <martin.thurn@ngc.com> 
 Subject: FAIL Data-SecsPack-0.02 sun4-solaris-thread-multi 2.8
 perl5: (revision 5.0 version 9 subversion 0)
 Platform: osname=solaris, osvers=2.8, archname=sun4-solaris-thread-multi

The test software failures were caused by invalid data from the UUT failure.
The UUT failures caused  non-numeric data for C<pass_fail_tolerance> in
C<SecsPackStress.t>. Corrected C<pass_fail_tolerance> by detecting non-numeric
data and returning a failure. 
Failure of UUT C<unpack_float> caused a C<undef> passed to C<binary2hex>.
Corrected C<binary2hex> by detecting and changing C<undef> to to C<''>.

There were two groups of UUT failures. 

In the first group the test results were as the test results was
two member array of C<Math::BigInt> number hash while the test
was expecting just two simple Perl numbers. 
The numbers in the C<Data::BigInt> hash were correct just in a
different format. For example,

 t/Data/SecsPackStress....# Test 2 got: 'U1[1] 80
 L[4]
   A[0]
   A[5] ARRAY
   L[6]
     A[12] Math::BigInt
     A[4] HASH
     A[4] sign
     A[1] +
     A[5] value
     U1[1] 128
   L[6]
     A[12] Math::BigInt
     A[4] HASH
     A[4] sign
     A[1] +
     A[5] value
     U1[1] 0
 ' (t/Data/SecsPackStress.t at line 184)
 #   Expected: 'U1[1] 80
 U1[2] 128 0
 '

The second group of failures the UUT C<unpack_float> subroutine
is always returning a NaN. This subroutine heavily uses the
native floating point for calcuations and it appears to
be limiting out with C<Not a Number> type error.

 # Test 27 got: '0' (t/Data/SecsPackStress.t at line 396 fail #2)
 #    Expected: '1' (got: NaN, expected: -10.5
 # actual tolerance: NaN, expected tolerance: 0.0001)

Check version of C<Math::BigInt> in the ActiveState Perl 5.06
distribution to those on CPAN. ActiveState C<Math::BigInt>
was 0.01 while CPAN was 1.70. The difference between the two
is night and day. Install C<Math::BigInt> 1.70.
Tests fails the same as above. 

Corrected all C<Data::SecsPack> subroutines to use new
features and intefaces of C<Math::BigInt> 1.70 including
a load C<die> if the C<Math::BitInt> version is not 1.70
or greater

Replaced as many native float operations as possible with
many new C<Math::BigInt> subroutines in Version 1.70 as possible.
Removed work arounds for subroutines such as C<rsft> do not
not work completely in 1.0 but do in 1.70. 
The C<unpack_float> subroutine
does not depend heavily on native float which comes in a different
flavor for each and every site. There may be exceptions to
this statement but if they are, they a few and far between.

=item Data::SecsPack 0.04

The anticipation was that there would be minor differences in 
floating point numbers due to different native floating point
implementations. This concern did not materialize. In addition, 
C<Data::BigFloat> replaced all native floating points.
Since floating point differences are no longer anticipation,
removed all tolerance criteria from the test scripts.
To pass the tests, the results will now have to be exactly
as expected.

Added the formats U8 and S8 to allowable formats for
C<unpack_int>. This was an oversight, a mistake.

Added the C<ascii_float> option to the C<str2float>
subroutine.  This is a new feature.

Switch to C<Data::Startup> for handling options.

=item Data::SecsPack 0.05

The C<str2float> subroutine did not recognize 0 as a number.
Added 0 to tests for C<str2float>.

=item *

Increase the accuracy of packing floats with
large exponents and unpacking floats.

=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

=item *

Most of the tests are GO path tests. Should add
some more NOGO tests and review the test to
see if they test each and every execution path.

=item *

Add requirements and trace between requirements
and the test that verifies the requirement.

There were the same test software failures and Unit Under Test (UUT) failures
for the following platforms:

 Subject: FAIL Data-SecsPack-0.02 ppc-darwin-thread-multi 7.2.0 
 From: nothingmuch@woobling.org

 perl5: (revision 5.0 version 9 subversion 0)
 Platform: osname=solaris, osvers=2.8, archname=sun4-solaris-thread-multi

The test software failures were caused by invalid data from the UUT failure.
The UUT failures caused  non-numeric data for C<pass_fail_tolerance> in
C<SecsPackStress.t>. Corrected C<pass_fail_tolerance> by detecting non-numeric
data and returning a failure. 
Failure of UUT C<unpack_float> caused a C<undef> passed to C<binary2hex>.
Corrected C<binary2hex> by detecting and changing C<undef> to to C<''>.

     A[12] Math::BigInt
     A[4] HASH
     A[4] sign
     A[1] +
     A[5] value
     U1[1] 0
 ' (t/Data/SecsPackStress.t at line 184)
 #   Expected: 'U1[1] 80
 U1[2] 128 0
 '

The second group of failures the UUT C<unpack_float> subroutine
is always returning a NaN. This subroutine heavily uses the
native floating point for calcuations and it appears to
be limiting out with C<Not a Number> type error.

 # Test 27 got: '0' (t/Data/SecsPackStress.t at line 396 fail #2)
 #    Expected: '1' (got: NaN, expected: -10.5
 # actual tolerance: NaN, expected tolerance: 0.0001)

this statement but if they are, they a few and far between.

\=item Data::SecsPack 0.04

The anticipation was that there would be minor differences in 
floating point numbers due to different native floating point
implementations. This concern did not materialize. In addition, 
C<Data::BigFloat> replaced all native floating points.
Since floating point differences are no longer anticipation,
removed all tolerance criteria from the test scripts.
To pass the tests, the results will now have to be exactly
as expected.

Added the formats U8 and S8 to allowable formats for
C<unpack_int>. This was an oversight, a mistake.

Added the C<ascii_float> option to the C<str2float>
subroutine.  This is a new feature.

Switch to C<Data::Startup> for handling options.

\=item Data::SecsPack 0.05

The C<str2float> subroutine did not recognize 0 as a number.
Added 0 to tests for C<str2float>.

DOCUMENT_OVERVIEW:
This document releases ${NAME} version ${VERSION}
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.
^

CAPABILITIES:
The "L<Data::SecsPack|Data::SecsPack>" module extends the Perl language (the system).

The subroutines in the C<Data::SecsPack> module packs and unpacks
numbers in accordance with SEMI E5-94. The E5-94 establishes the
standard for communication between the equipment used to fabricate
semiconductors and the host computer that controls the fabrication.
The equipment in a semiconductor factory (fab) or any other fab
contains every conceivable known microprocessor and operating system
known to man. And there are a lot of specialize real-time embedded 
processors and speciallize real-time embedded operating systems
in addition to the those in the PC world.

The communcication between host and equipment used packed
nested list data structures that include arrays of characters,
integers and floats. The standard has been in place and widely
used in China, Germany, Korea, Japan, France, Italy and
the most remote places on this planent for decades.
The SEMI E5 standard was first finalized in 1985 and has
not changed much over the decades.
The basic data structure and packed data formats have not
changed for decades. 
This stands in direct contradiction to common conceptions
of many in the Perl snail-time community that
there is no standard for transferring such things as
binary floats between machines little less sending
nested list data as small compact binary.

The C<Data::Str2int> module translates an scalar string to a scalar integer.
Perl itself has a documented function, '0+$x', that converts a scalar to
so that its internal storage is an integer
(See p.351, 3rd Edition of Programming Perl).
If it cannot perform the conversion, it leaves the integer 0.
Surprising not all Perls, some Microsoft Perls in particular, may leave
the internal storage as a scalar string.

The <str2int> function is basically the same except if it cannot perform
the conversion to an integer, it returns an "undef" instead of a 0.
Also, if the string is a decimal or floating point, it will return an undef.
This makes it not only useful for forcing an integer conversion but
also for testing a scalar to see if it is in fact an integer scalar.

PROBLEMS:
There is still much work needed to ensure the quality 
of this module as follows:

\=over 4

\=item *

Increase the accuracy of packing floats with
large exponents and unpacking floats.

\=item *

State the functional requirements for each method 
including not only the GO paths but also what to
expect for the NOGO paths

\=item *

Most of the tests are GO path tests. Should add
some more NOGO tests and review the test to
see if they test each and every execution path.

\=item *

Add requirements and trace between requirements
and the test that verifies the requirement.
